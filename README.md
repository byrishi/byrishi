## Profile

I work on **ambiguous problems at the intersection of business, product, and execution**.

My background spans **SaaS, product management, creative systems, and early-stage ventures**, where I’ve translated unclear problem statements into structured actions and shipped outcomes under constraints.

I’m particularly interested in **strategy, market analysis, operating models, and execution planning**.
